# Project Bravio

*bravi≈ç* - Latin for prize, brave, and *gamble*.

Project Bravio is a side projects hub for [@azharichenko](https://github.com/azharichenko), [@avigloz](https://github.com/avigloz), and [@rohit-ganguly](https://github.com/rohit-ganguly). It's designed to be a place for us to practice software engineering fundamentals and most importantly, *roll the dice* on some things we want to try to code.

Maybe you'll hear about some of the projects we've put together eventually. If we make something worth sharing, you'll read it here :)
